# Architecture plan 

Add additional functionality around the Lock up Eigen token that is on Ethereum. Some of the rewards that would be minted would go back to be restaked (or user depends on the settings) and some of the rewards would go to fund other chains.

When the user would deploy lock up their tokens they would also get some voting LASTIC tokens that would allow them to determine with what layer 2 they want to support, or they could even delegate their vote to someone else.
